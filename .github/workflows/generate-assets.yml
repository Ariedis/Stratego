name: Generate Game Assets

# Runs once when the asset-generation branch is pushed.
# Downloads real Stratego piece images from Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0)
# and generates board tile images using pygame-ce, then commits the results
# back to the branch so they are available in the PR.
#
# The job is skipped automatically if assets were already committed by a
# previous run (detected by checking whether assets/pieces/ already exists).
