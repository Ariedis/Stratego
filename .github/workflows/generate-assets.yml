name: Generate Game Assets

# Runs once when the asset-generation branch is pushed.
# Downloads real Stratego piece images from Wikimedia Commons (CC BY-SA 4.0)
# and generates board tile images using Python's built-in struct/zlib, then
# commits the results back to the branch so they are available in the PR.
#
# The job is skipped automatically on the auto-commit that already added the
# assets (detected by checking the commit message).
